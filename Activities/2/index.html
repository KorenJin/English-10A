                        - Usually at parties we could be double-dipping our food and that has been an historical concern in health and safety for people in meetings

                        <br> <br> 

                        - There's very little research about whether this behaviour is actually dangerous

                        <br> <br> 

                        - Researchers conducted an experiment with 3 bowls of chocolate syrup, salsa and nacho cheese

                        <br> <br> 

                        - They found out that 3 to 6 double-dips was a pretty standard number of a double-dipping session, ant that it brought 10,000 bacteria from the mouth to the bowl in average

                        <br> <br> 

                        - But the salsa had more bacteria transfered compared to the other two bowls

                        <br> <br> 

                        - Scientists say that this was due to the thickness of the salsa and therefore when dippping some parts of the salsa will come back to the bowl, bringing some bacteria with it

                        <br> <br> 

                        -  But after 2 hours, most bacteria in the salsa bowl died, and researchers attribute this to the acidic enviroment of the salsa, with a pH of around 4 in average.

                        <br> <br> 

                        - So if you're looking to minimize the risk of double-dipping, you should go for a bowl that are super thicc or super acidic, or both

                        <br> <br> 

                        - Though double-dipping hasn't been proved to be actually risk, because the bacteria in the mouth is actual harmless and healthy in most cases

                        <br> <br> 

                        - In order to get a particular disease, you will need a particular amount of bacteria entering your system to become sick, this is called the infectious dose

                        <br> <br> 

                        - It also depends on the germ that is on the bowl, some germes like herpes will be need to be on the mouth so they could be dangerousin these cases. But some germ need to reach deeper in the body to actually be infectious, which could be killed on the path of the digestive system.

                        <br> <br> 

                        - Despite that, it is actually possible to get the infectious doses

                        <br> <br> 

                        -  Scientists also mentioned that double-dipping is not the only activity that is risky for the health in a party. We could kiss, touch other people, hand-shake, etc.

                        <br> <br> 

                        - Some cultures share foods and it is not a problem and has not been a problem for them

                    <div id="reflectiontext"> 

                        - Since 16th century, people have been considering double-dipping as a bad habit.

                        <br> <br> 

                        - A test was made of double-dipping in 3 bowls of chocolate syrup, salsa and nacho cheese.

                        <br> <br> 

                        - More bacteria was transferred to the salsa

                        <br> <br> 

                        - This was due to thickness of the salsa

                        <br> <br> 

                        - The acid enviroment of the salsa helped killed bacteria

                        <br> <br> 

                        - double-dipping does transfer bacteria between people

                        <br> <br> 

                        - But it is not 100% dangerous, whether the other person gets sick depends on how their body fight against the bacteria

                        <br> <br> 

                        - You need to pick up a large dose of the bacteria or virus to get sick

                        <br> <br> 

                        - It also depends on where the pathogen needs to go to start its reproduction

                        <br> <br> 

                        - If the sickness starts in the mouth for example, then it is extremely dangerous

                        <br> <br> 

                        - There's some risk by getting sick of it, but it is not the only thing that can make you vulnerable at a party 

                        <br> <br> 

                        - There are many variables, double-dipping isn't the biggest health risk at a party

                        <br> <br> 

                        - Many cultures in the world share the same food, so double-dipping is not a big deal for them

    <div class="subtitle"> Summary </div>  
    <div id="cornelltext">
        
        The talk, titled "The Truth About Double-Dipping" by MinuteFood, explores the historical concern of double-dipping at parties and its potential impact on health and safety. The author discusses a limited amount of research on this behavior, citing an experiment involving bowls of chocolate syrup, salsa, and nacho cheese. The study reveals that 3 to 6 double-dips can transfer an average of 10,000 bacteria from the mouth to the bowl, with salsa exhibiting more bacteria transfer due to its thickness. Interestingly, the acidic environment of the salsa helps eliminate most bacteria after 2 hours.

        <br> <br> 

        While the talk suggests opting for thick or acidic bowls to minimize the risk of double-dipping, it emphasizes that double-dipping hasn't been proven to be a significant health risk. The presentation touches on the concept of infectious doses, highlighting that specific amounts of bacteria are required to cause illness. The risk also depends on the nature of the pathogen and where it needs to go for reproduction.

        <br> <br> 

        The speaker acknowledges that other activities at parties, such as kissing, touching, and handshakes, also pose health risks. Cultures that share food have not found double-dipping to be problematic. In conclusion, the talk underscores that while double-dipping does transfer bacteria, it is not the sole or most significant health risk at a party, with various factors influencing the potential for illness.

                <p> Why did I choose this video? <br>
                    <div id="reflectiontext"> 
                        
                        I really enjoyed watching this video; it was not too long and provided a lot of information in a short period of time. I also liked the way the author presented the information; it was very clear and easy to understand. An example of the techniques the author used to make this video easier to understand was the use of graphics and edits over images, which made it seem like the intended audience was very broad. A specific case of the use of graphics was when the author placed three images of bacteria on the salsa bowl, and most people could recognize it as such. Then, she removed two of them when mentioning that the bacteria died after 2 hours, which helps anyone who is not an expert in the topic understand the information.

            <div class="col"> 
                <p> Would you like to continue using this note-taking method when you listen to future talks in English? Why/Why not? <br>
                    <div id="reflectiontext"> 

                        Honestly, I would never use this method again, and there are several reasons for that.

                        <br> <br> 

                        Firstly, it forces you to pay exclusive attention to what you write without looking at the video itself. This results in losing the context of the video, preventing a holistic understanding of the information. It also hinders the experience of the video as it was intended to be enjoyed.

                        <br> <br> 

                        Secondly, in terms of my career, this technique holds no utility for me. The majority of my work revolves around practical computer skills rather than jotting down information on paper. Furthermore, the concepts required for my jobs are mostly learned in college, providing a foundation that aligns with the basics of our modern technology. Thus, the method falls short in addressing the practical and visual nature of these foundational concepts, as you can't focus on the visualization of a circuit of a computer while writing down notes for example.

                        <br> <br> 

                        Lastly, in the context of daily life, this technique proves highly impractical for me. I typically enjoy researching from multiple sources simultaneously. Relying on understanding one source at a time consumes valuable time that could be better spent researching more sources, gathering additional information, or pursuing my hobbies.

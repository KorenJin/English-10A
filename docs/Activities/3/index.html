                            This video will talk about UI hacks that I as a software developer can use and apply to the websites I make, perharps this one for example (which i did from scrath). I think the UI hacks that probably will be mentioned are:

                            <br> <br>

                            1. The use of colors to make the website more appealing to the user. For example, the use of a dark theme for a website that is meant to be used at night, or the use of a light theme for a website that is meant to be used during the day.

                            <br> <br>

                            2. The use of animations to make the website more appealing to the user. For example, the use of a loading animation to make the user feel like the website is working, or the use of a transition animation to make the user feel like the website is responsive.

                            <br> <br>

                            3. The use of images to make the website more appealing to the user. For example, the use of a background image to make the website more visually appealing, or the use of a logo to make the website more memorable.

                            <br> <br>

                            4. The use of fonts to make the website more appealing to the user. For example, the use of a serif font to make the website more formal, or the use of a sans-serif font to make the website more casual.

                            <br> <br>

                            5. The use of icons to make the website more appealing to the user. For example, the use of a heart icon to make the website more romantic, or the use of a star icon to make the website more popular.

                            <br> <br>

                            6. The use of buttons to make the website more appealing to the user. For example, the use of a button to make the website more interactive, or the use of a button to make the website more responsive.

                    </div> 
                </p> 
            </div>
            <div class="col"> 
                <p> Comparison <br>
                    <div id="reflectiontext"> 

                        In reality, all of these hacks are fundamentally rooted in how we manipulate typography, a point I hinted at in my predictions, although it was merely listed as a bullet point without specifying the topic of the hacks.

                        <br> <br>

                        Regarding the first hack, the author highlights the importance of appropriate line-height, a topic I did not anticipate in my predictions.

                        <br> <br>

                        Moving on to the second hack, the author emphasizes the significance of letter spacing, especially in titles, as a crucial element for creating a formal, important, or humorous look based on context. This was not covered in my initial predictions.

                        <br> <br>

                        The third hack addresses the combination of centered texts and long paragraphs, discussing their negative impact on user reading speed and providing insights on visual design. Again, this was not part of my predictions.

                        <br> <br>

                        Concerning the fourth hack, the author underscores the drawbacks of using long paragraphs in design, citing studies that reveal potential misunderstandings of product or service benefits by users. This aspect was not included in my predictions.

                        <br> <br>

                        The fifth point advises limiting websites to at most two font sizes and relying on font weight changes to emphasize certain words. While I touched on this in my predictions, it wasn't in the same manner as the author presented.

                        <br> <br>

                        The last hack introduces a smart and useful practice: employing appropriate spacing between subheadings and their respective bodies. The author provides a specific guideline for maintaining consistent spacing between different sections, a concept I did not cover in my predictions.

                    </div> 
                </p> 
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



    <div class="subtitle" id="multiword"> Useful expresions for summary </div>  
    <div id="summarytext">
        
        - Typography <br>
        - Line-height <br>
        - Letter spacing <br>
        - Centered texts <br>
        - Long paragraphs <br>
        - Font weight <br>
        - Spacing between subheadings <br>

    </div>



    <div class="subtitle" id="summaryaudio"> Summary </div>
    <audio id="audio" controls>
        <source src="/Media/Activities/3/summary.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

    </audio>
    <div id="endaudio"></div>



    <div class="subtitle" id="reflections"> Reflections </div>    

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row" id="titles">
            <div class="col"> 
                <p> What was easy/difficult about this listening experience and why? <br>
                    <div id="reflectiontext"> 
                        
                        Honestly speaking, this listening experience was relatively easy because I had prior knowledge of the theory discussed, and the vocabulary used was not complex. In the field of software engineering, educational videos often feature straightforward language. This simplicity can be attributed to the fact that many creators in this space are not native English speakers. Additionally, the English-speaking community within technology YouTubers is smaller compared to the international audience in Europe, Asia, and India. Consequently, the vocabulary tends to rely more on technical terms rather than complex English words.

                    </div> 
                </p> 
            </div>
            <div class="col"> 
                <p> What future relevance might this listening experience have for you? <br>
                    <div id="reflectiontext"> 

                        I find this listening experience to be valuable for my future endeavors. As a prospective expert in my field, effective communication with fellow experts will be crucial. Being able to comprehend their ideas and articulate mine clearly is essential for successful collaboration. That's why I view this listening experience as pertinent to my future.

                        <br> <br>
                        
                        Furthermore, incorporating multiword expressions and technical jargon can enhance the clarity and conciseness of speech. This proficiency will enable me to communicate my ideas more efficiently and effectively.
